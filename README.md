# A sample git explanation

So, today I was trying to explain how **git** works to an intern, and had some troubles to do so.
The problematics about this person were :
- almost no knowledges in this tool
- not quite a "computer person"
- not fluent in english

After a while, I figured out a metaphoric speech would be more appropriate to explain it. 
Then I thought : "Why not to publish that online, as it may help non tech. people to understand how git works ?".

By the way... please understand that this article is made for *very beginners* and some things will be over simplified (they might even seems wrong to you !) for them to understand what **git** is.

## A few words about the tool

**Git** is a versioning tool, which is usefull for collaborative work, but also for keeping trace of what we do in time, and **much more** things.
I won't spend a lot of time talking about those concepts, as it is not the topic of this post and it has been done a lot of time and by many people ; to learn more you can read the [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control](Atlassian documentation about it) which is very well done in my opinion.
