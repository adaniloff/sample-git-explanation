# What is git ?

Let's compare our **git** project's lifecycle to a book one (in our case, it will be a dictionnary).

## The __edition__

Here are a few assertions to keep in mind :
- 1 or more __contributors__ can contribute
- to be quicker, the work is splitted among the __contributors__
  > That means, each __contributor__ will work on 1 or more __chapters__
- a __contributor__ will make __versions__ of the __chapters__ that he is in charge
  > That will help them to save their work, for example
- the end goal is to make a __publishing__ of the dictionnary, which basically is all the merged __chapters__ at their final __versions__ 

Basically, I just explained to you the following principles :
> A __contributor__ is someone which wants to get involved in the project   
> A __publishing__ of the dictionnary is a **project's release**    
> A __chapter__ of the dictionnary, which can change through the time, is a **branch**    
> A __version__ of the dictionnary, at a given time, is a **commit**    

## The __reading__

Which steps will have to make a __reader__ before being able to read his dictionnary ?
- get the dictionnary
- read it

Keep in mind though, that our **git project** (our dictionnary) is opensource, and free to people to get it and contribute to its development.
That means, a __contributor__ will be able to suggest some modifications to our dictionnary.

In short :
> A __reader__ is someone who wants to use our **project**, without working on it    
> The __reading__ is the usage of our **project** through :    
> -- the different __versions__ (**commits**) for __contributors__    
> -- the different __publishings__ (**releases**) for __customers__    

## The __editor__

I'm not gonna talk about **remotes** right now, as it might make it harder to you but try to think about it like below :
> A **remote** is an __editor__. You migth, in some specific cases, want to __publish__ your work with many of them, but that's not what we're doing here.

So, the thing to remember is, your default __editor__ is called "origin".
