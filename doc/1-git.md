# Understanding git

Let's compare our **git project** lifecycle to a book one (in our case, it will be a __dictionnary__).

#### Quick vocabulary resume

- the __dictionnary__ is our --> **git project**
- a __chapter__ is a --> **git branch**
- a __version__ is a --> **git commit**
- a __publishing__ is a --> **project release**

## The __reading__

Which steps will have to make a __reader__ before being able to read his dictionnary ?
- get the __dictionnary__
- read it

Keep in mind though, that our __dictionnary__ is opensource, and free to people to get it and contribute to its development.
That means, a __contributor__ will be able to suggest some modifications to our dictionnary.

## The __edition__

Here are a few assertions to keep in mind :
- Many __contributors__ can contribute
- to be quicker, the work is splitted amongst the __contributors__
  > Each __contributor__ will then work on one or many __chapters__
- a __contributor__ will make some __versions__ of the __chapters__ that he's in charge
  > That will help them to save their work, for example
- the end goal is to make a __publishing__ of the dictionnary, which basically is all the merged __chapters__ at their final __versions__   

## A few ascertainments : 

> A __reader__ is someone who wants to get our __dictionnary__ for usage only    
> A __contributor__ is a person who wants to get involved into the __dictionnary__ development    
> The usage of our __dictionnary__ can be done through :    
> -- the different __versions__ (**commits**, mainly for __contributors__)    
> -- the different __publishings__ (**releases**, mainly for __readers__)

## The __editor__

I'm not gonna talk about **remotes** right now, as it might make it harder to you but try to think about it like below :
> A **remote** is an __editor__. You migth, in some specific cases, want to __publish__ your work with many of them, but that's not what we're doing here.

So, the thing to remember is, your default __editor__ is called "origin".
